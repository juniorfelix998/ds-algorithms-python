Question

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

def sort_colors(nums):
    low = 0
    mid = 0
    high = len(nums) - 1

    while mid <= high:
        if nums[mid] == 0:
            nums[low], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[low]
            low += 1
            mid += 1
        elif nums[mid] == 1:
            mid += 1
        else:  # nums[mid] == 2
            nums[mid], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[mid]
            high -= 1

    return nums


numbers = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
print(sort_colors(numbers))
